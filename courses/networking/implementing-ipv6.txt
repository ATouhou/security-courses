Hvad siger du til at holde et IPV6 oplæg i Aalborg. Det skal være konkret på hvordan, implementering, overgang, mulighed for at bevare gammel struktur internet og åbne eksternt med IPV6 (pros & cons), bær over med min formulering, det ca sådan jeg hørte det ;O)





Implementing IPv6 in real networks

Duration: 3 hours

The content of this presentation includes a short introduction to IPv6. Practical information about 
implementing IPv6 in the network, what parts does IPv6 affect, which parts will run as usual. Managing devices with IPv4 and IPv6 while migrating from IPv4-only, through IPv4/IPv6 dual stack and to IPv6 only networks.

The differences and similarities of IPv4 and IPv6 will be shown using real life examples from devices from major vendors such as Cisco, Juniper and Dell. Configuration of both server and client operating systems will also be shown in detail. The participants will after this presentation be able to design and modify their own networks to support IPv6.
