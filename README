Welcome to security-courses a free template and security courses
written in LaTeX code, but assumed to be used anyway by novices.

Feel free to send comments to me: hlk@security6.net

Howto get the sources

Committers use the normal ssh access to the server, or perhaps
they should get access inside the jail - haven't decided.

So checkout for me and committers is:
  svn checkout "svn+ssh://laura/path_to_jail/svn/security-courses"

while others should use svn+ssh with user anonsvn and port 2222:
$ SVN_SSH="ssh -p 2222" svn checkout svn+ssh://anonsvn@svn.kramse.dk/svn/security-courses/trunk





$ SVN_SSH="ssh -p 2222" svn co svn+ssh://anonsvn@svn.kramse.dk/svn/security-courses/trunk/security-courses


or you could put this into your $HOME/.ssh/config:
host svn.kramse.dk
        port 2222

I recommend doing the latter, since any further update would be:
$ svn up
instead of
$ SVN_SSH="ssh -p 2222" svn up

This should give you a checkout and you can update your local copy,
but not write to the repository. 

Sorry for the port change, but I really hate to see my logs fill up.

What you need
You need some installation of LaTeX, for instance the TeXLive
See this reference: http://www.tug.org/texlive/

Be sure to install:
ppower4 post processor
pagetrans.sty - if you want fancy page transitions


When LaTeX is installed you should update your settings, to easily
use your own extensions etc.

As an example my login profile on my Mac OS X laptop contains:
# latex settings
export BIBINPUTS=:~/projects/latex/bibtex
export TEXINPUTS=:~/security6.net/regnskab:~/projects/latex//
MANPATH=$MANPATH:/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf/doc/man
INFOPATH=$INFOPATH:/usr/local/texlive/2007/texmf/doc/info


Why LaTeX
I love LaTeX and it easily produces high-quality output
both for printing and screen presentations.

If you don't know LaTeX then use the existing presentations
as they probably contain most of what you need.

Adding LaTeX code in the middle of a document is wrong,
you should rather update the classes and stylesheet for that!
(I know some of my presentations contain LaTeX-code in the
middle, sorry I am lazy ;-) )


License
This is supposed to be free. Free as in you can do almost
whatever you like according to the LICENSE - which is a 
standard BSD-like license. So you are free to use this
even for commercial purposes.

Images are a special case as there are screenshots. 
Screenshots are considered to be references and
citations, which according to danish law are allowed
to be included. Most screenshots are from Open Source
projects anyway, but if you have any problems with
this please contact the developers.
