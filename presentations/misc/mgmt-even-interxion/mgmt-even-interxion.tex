{Securing the transition to the Cloud}

\slide{Todays subject}
\vskip 2 cm

\begin{list1}
\item \Large Transitioning to the Cloud
\item Short overview of your changed responsibilities when\\
implementing cloud
\end{list1}

\slide{Today - the network IS the computer}

\begin{list1}
\item Buzzword bingo: Cloud, SOAP, REST, XML, ...
\item Platform as a Service (PaaS) is the delivery of a computing platform and solution stack as a service.
\item Software as a service (SaaS)
\item High complexity but also computing thought as a utility like water, gas, power
\end{list1}

Dependencies: your power, your internet, your servers, your people

\slide{Interxion at a Glance}

\hlkimage{16cm}{td-day.png}
\begin{list1}
\item Outsourcing data centers is nothing new, Interxion was founded in 1998 
\item Carrier neutral data centers with 400+ carriers/ISPs in 29 datacenters\\
across 18 internet exchanges 
\vskip 1cm
\item Today servers are being migrated to and from centers, to and from providers - easily
\end{list1}




\slide{Cloud Security - different but the same}

\hlkimage{12cm}{images/cia-triad-uk.pdf}

Everything today is cloud - but did we loose security? and what is security?

Did you ask security questions? Did you even think about security when deciding to do cloud computing?

\slide{Take Charge of Your Security}

We have more customers asking about 
\begin{list2}
\item ISO/IEC 27001 - information security management system standards\\
\link{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_27001}
\item SSAE 16 No. 16, Reporting on Controls at a Service Organization\\ 
Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) \link{http://ssae16.com/}
\item ISAE 3402 Assurance Reports on Controls at a Service Organization\\
International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE)
\link{http://isae3402.com/}
\item Independent assessment from a trusted security firm - which must often also be certified
\item Physical Security, power, HVAC - trusted partners reviewing security
\item Implementing standards is also security
\end{list2}

Over the years organisations have become more mature with regards to security

Implementing security controls were easier when you owned all resources

\slide{Cloud Vendor Requirements}

What about requirements for Cloud vendors?

Did you at least ask these?
\begin{list2}
\item Service levels 
\item Connectivity
\item Multiple locations - we know and you know that a single data center is a single point of failure
\item Maybe use multiple clouds - do not put all your eggs in one basket\\
Recommend selecting clouds with open APIs so you can move between clouds!
\end{list2}

If you are a large organisation you will have (manual) procedures if business critical systems fail, but can you handle {\bf all of them failing at the same time?}

\slide{New world order is connected}

We have realized everything is connected, even when not using cloud
\begin{list2}
\item Internet connectivity is crucial - need redundant connections to work force locations
\item Luckily work force is very mobile today
\item Some tools like email is used around the clock
\item Controlling your data outside of the enterprise requires thought
\item Make sure to evaluate risks for each application, each provider - and also as a whole
\item Make formalized procedures for security clearance - also when using clouds internationally\\
What data can you put in the US, EU, outside of EU - and what are the external legal requirements
\end{list2}


\slide{Wrapping up}

Congratulations - you are already using cloud. Some of your services are dependent on cloud systems. Are you aware of your risks?

\begin{list2}
\item Re-evaluate your business critical systems, which ones are using cloud today, is the current controls sufficient
\item Re-asses the risk to data. There are leaks and security breaches daily around the world. Is your data secure?
\item Redo your disaster recovery procedures - maybe split business critical systems between multiple cloud vendors - to reduce risk of all failing at once.

\item 

behov for sikring og kontrol, samt security metrics
\end{list2}

Your security department is probably already doing this, since they have increasingly become a service to the organisation - only change is some systems moved into the cloud.

%\slide{The future}

%\begin{list1}
%\item Solido Networks ser en udvikling mod at alt skubbes ud, outsourcing af alle services
%\item Systemerne var uafhængige og self-contained, men er idag afhængige af andre services for at virke
%\end{list1}
