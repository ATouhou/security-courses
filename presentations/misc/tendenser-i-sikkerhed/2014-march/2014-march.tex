\begin{quote}
	Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world. ~A Cypherpunk's Manifesto by Eric Hughes, 1993

\slide{But DNS is bad! DNS Amplification?!}

\begin{quote}
This is the official homepage for PacketQ, a simple tool to make SQL-queries against PCAP-files, making packet analysis and building statistics simple and quick. PacketQ was previously known as DNS2db but was renamed in 2011 when it was rebuilt and could handle protocols other than DNS among other things.

Look how easy it's to count DNS-packets in a PCAP-file.
\end{quote}

\begin{alltt}

\slide{Detecting DDoS}

We can ask RDDtools about max, average etc.

\slide{DDoS traffic after filtering}
\hlkimage{18cm}{ddos-after-filtering}
\centerline{Link toward server (next level firewall actually) about ~350Mbit outgoing}

\slide{Strategy planning}

\begin{list1}
\item Problem: We receive unauthenticated chaotic traffic

\item Solution: Discard early, discard on edge, reduce noise

\item Only use CPU resources for potentially real traffic
\end{list1}

\slide{Defense in depth - multiple layers of security}

\hlkimage{23cm}{network-layers-1.pdf}


%\slide{Stateless filtering Junos}
\slide{Stateless firewall filter throw stuff away}

\begin{alltt}\footnotesize
hlk@MX-CPH-02> show configuration firewall filter all | no-more
/* This is a sample, better to use BGP flowspec and RTBH */
inactive: term edgeblocker \{
    from \{
        source-address \{
            84.180.xxx.173/32;
...
            87.245.xxx.171/32;
        \}
        destination-address \{
            91.102.91.16/28;
        \}
        protocol [ tcp udp icmp ];
    \}
    then \{
        count edge-block;
        discard;
    \}
\}
\end{alltt}
Hint: can also leave out protocol and then it will match all protocols

\slide{Stateless firewall filter limit protocols}

\begin{alltt}\footnotesize
term limit-icmp \{
    from \{
        protocol icmp;
    \}
    then \{
        policer ICMP-100M;
        accept;
    \}
\}
term limit-udp \{
    from \{
        protocol udp;
    \}
    then \{
        policer UDP-1000M;
        accept;
    \}
\}
\end{alltt}

Routers also have extensive Class-of-Service (CoS) tools today

\slide{Strict filtering for some servers, still stateless!}

\begin{alltt}\footnotesize
term some-server-allow \{
    from \{
        destination-address \{
            109.238.xx.0/xx;
        \}
        protocol tcp;
        destination-port [ 80 443 ];
    \}
    then accept;
\}
term some-server-block-unneeded \{

    \}
    then \{
        count some-server-block;
        discard;
    \}
\}
\end{alltt}

Wut - no UDP, yes UDP service is not used on these servers


\slide{ Firewalls - screens, IDS like features}

When you know regular traffic you can decide:

\begin{alltt}\small
hlk@srx-kas-05# show security screen ids-option untrust-screen
icmp \{    ping-death; \}
ip \{    source-route-option;  tear-drop; \}
tcp \{    Note: UDP flood setting also exist
    syn-flood \{
        alarm-threshold 1024;
        attack-threshold 200;
        source-threshold 1024;
        destination-threshold 2048;
        timeout 20;    \}
    land;
\} Always select your own settings YMMV
\end{alltt}

\begin{list2}
\item Firewalls and security devices have lots of settings
\item How many sessions does a single IP need?
\item This can be done with reduced incoming traffic
\end{list2}

\slide{uRPF unicast Reverse Path Forwarding}

\centerline{\bf Solving DDoS problems uRPF}

\begin{quote}
Reverse path forwarding (RPF) is a technique used in modern routers for the purposes of ensuring loop-free forwarding of multicast packets in multicast routing and to help prevent IP address spoofing in unicast routing.
\end{quote}
Source: \link{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_path_forwarding}

\slide{Strict vs loose mode RPF}

\hlkimage{24cm}{uRPF-check-1.pdf}

\begin{quote}
{\bf Configuring Unicast RPF Strict Mode}\\
In strict mode, unicast RPF checks whether the incoming packet has a source address that matches a prefix in the routing table, {\bf and whether the interface expects to receive a packet with this source address prefix.}
\end{quote}

\slide{Summary: Goal of protection mechanisms}

\begin{list1}
\item DDoS attacks increase in size
\item +100Gb happens regularly
\item Even 200Gb is becoming more common
\item No vendor can deliver a single device with 100\%
\item Slice the attacks - Divide and conquer
\item Use the available features and resources in combination - optimize your infrastructure
\end{list1}

\slide{Allowed traffic to next layer}

\begin{list1}
\item Basic filtering and routers can eliminate a lot

\item Characteristics after employing the techniques:
\item Known bad sources removed 
\item Maximum 100Mbit ICMP
\item Maximum 1000Mbit UDP
\item Only port 80/tcp and 443/tcp to some range
\end{list1}
