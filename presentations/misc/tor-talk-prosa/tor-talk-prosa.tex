Cryptography is peaceful protest against blanket surveillance

	Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world. ~A Cypherpunk's Manifesto by Eric Hughes, 1993

\slide{TOR crypto Use version 2.4+}

\begin{quote}
{\bf Tor is still DHE 1024 (NSA crackable)}

By Robert Graham\\
After more revelations, and expert analysis, we still aren't precisely sure what crypto the NSA can break. But everyone seems to agree that if anything, the NSA can break 1024 RSA/DH keys. Assuming no "breakthroughs", the NSA can spend \$1 billion on custom chips that can break such a key in a few hours. We know the NSA builds custom chips, they've got fairly public deals with IBM foundries to build chips.

The problem with Tor is that it still uses these 1024 bit keys for much of its crypto, particularly because most people are still using older versions of the software. The older 2.3 versions of Tor uses keys the NSA can crack, {\bf but few have upgraded to the newer 2.4 version with better keys.}

\slide{The future of Tor cryptography}

\begin{quote}
After the last round of revelations from Edward Snowden, described as "explosive" by Bruce Schneier, several threads started on the tor-talk mailing list to discuss Tor cryptography.
A lot of what has been written is speculative at this point. But some have raised concerns about 1024 bit Diffie-Hellman key exchange. {\bf This has already been addressed with the introduction of the "ntor" handshake in 0.2.4 and Nick Mathewson encourages everybody to upgrade.}

\slide{UK: Seize smart phones and download data}

\begin{quote}
Officers use counter-terrorism laws to remove a mobile phone from any passenger they wish coming through UK air, sea and international rail ports and then scour their data.

The blanket power is so broad they do not even have to show reasonable suspicion for seizing the device and can retain the information for "as long as is necessary".

Data can include call history, contact books, photos and who the person is texting or emailing, although not the contents of messages.
